# 🌟 Core-DAO_dApp 🌟

Welcome to the *Core-DAO_dApp* project! We're building a decentralized application (dApp) leveraging the power of blockchain to store and reference data securely and transparently. Let's dive into the world of decentralized apps and create something extraordinary together!

## 🚀 What Are We Building?

In this project, we'll develop a simple dApp using *React.js* and *Ethers.js* that interacts with smart contracts on the *Core blockchain*. Our dApp will allow users to store and retrieve data in a smart contract and display it in an intuitive front-end interface.

## 🎓 Learning Takeaways

By following this tutorial, you'll gain knowledge and hands-on experience in:
